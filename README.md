## Role-Based Access

The backend uses JWT authentication and role middleware.

- Student-only routes are protected with the `student` role.
- Teacher-only routes are protected with the `teacher` role.
- Admin-only routes are protected with the `admin` role.
- The auth middleware verifies the current user from MongoDB before authorizing protected requests.

## Notes

- Streams and subjects are stored in MongoDB and managed from the admin panel.
- Student registration and profile stream dropdowns use the real stream records from the backend.
- Teacher class posts only become visible to students after admin approval.
- Student dashboard exam countdown uses August 1 of the selected A/L year.
